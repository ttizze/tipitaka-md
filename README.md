# tipitaka2500: The World Tipiṭaka Edition

*“The Buddhist Era 2500 Great International Council Pāḷi Tipiṭaka, Roman Script 2005” (Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka Buddhavasse 2500)*

This repository contains the complete 40-volume Roman-script edition of the 25-century old teaching of the Buddhist Theravāda tradition in the Pāḷi language from the B.E. 2500 (1957) Great Internatonal Buddhist Council converted into Markdown files.

It is derived from the Chaṭṭhasaṅgīti Council Edition, the Pāḷi-language text in Burmese Script, the result of the Great International Tipiṭaka Council convened in B.E. 2500 (1957) at Yangon by 2,500 erudite Theravāda Buddhist monks from all over the world.

The Roman Edition is the result of the work of The World Tipiṭaka Project B.E. 2542-2554 (1999-2011), by the M.L. Maniratana Bunnag Dhamma Society Fund under the Patronage of His Holiness Somdet Phra Ñāṇasaṁvara, the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand.

In preparation of the Roman-script text, the Dhamma Society partly based its Pāḷi language manuscript on two different sources which were presented as gifts of Dhamma to the Dhamma Society. However, the Dhamma Society found that the data from both sources contained significant anomalies and primary printing mistakes. With great care and under rigorous computer-controlled procedures, the project committee decided to undertake anew the proof-reading, including special Pāḷi recitation by canonical Tipiṭaka experts, who recited the entire text 4 times between B.E. 2543-2545 (2000-2002) and B.E. 2549-2550 (2006-2007) to verify every Pāḷi sound and to correct the printing errors of the original 40-volume manuscript. This proof-reading totalled to 2,708,706 words in Pāḷi or 20,606,104 letters in Roman script.
